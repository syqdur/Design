I'm running a migration from Replit Agent to Replit environment. This ensures your wedding gallery app will run cleanly with proper security practices and client/server separation. This process may take a little time as I work through the checklist to make everything compatible. Let me check the current state and continue with the migration:

I understand - you can't click on the location overlay to remove the geotag. Let me examine how location tags are displayed as overlays and add the removal functionality.
element.style {
min-height: 22px;
min-width: 22px;
}

I'll update the minimum height and width from 22px to 30px for the tagging buttons. Let me find and modify those styles:

Perfect! I've increased the left margin from ml-2 to ml-6, which moves the music button (and challenges button) significantly further to the right. This creates more space between the center upload button and the right-side navigation tabs.

Change Made
✓ Music Tab Moved Further Right: Increased left margin from 8px to 24px (ml-6) for better positioning

The music navigation button should now be positioned further to the right as requested, creating better visual balance in the navigation bar.
